⭐ 1. What is Bancor?

Bancor is one of the first AMMs ever created (before Uniswap v2).
It introduced the concept of:

✔️ Smart tokens
✔️ Single-sided liquidity
✔️ Impermanent Loss Protection
✔️ Protocol-owned insurance fund
✔️ Use of a network token (BNT) as a middle asset

⭐ 2. The Key Feature: “Single-Sided Liquidity”

In Uniswap, LP must deposit:

✔️ 2 tokens
✔️ In equal value
❌ Always exposed to IL

But in Bancor, an LP can provide JUST ONE TOKEN.

Examples:

Provide only ETH

Provide only LINK

Provide only USDT

You don’t need the pair.

This already reduces IL dramatically because you’re not forced to hold 50% of the opposite asset.

⭐ 3. How Does Bancor Allow Single-Sided Liquidity?

Because every pool always contains BNT, Bancor’s native token.

Example Bancor pools:

ETH/BNT

LINK/BNT

USDC/BNT

When you deposit only ETH:

Bancor mints BNT on the other side

Balances the pool

Allows swaps like:

ETH ↔ BNT

BNT ↔ LINK

ETH ↔ LINK (via BNT routing)

Because of this mechanism, Bancor pools always remain balanced.

⭐ 4. How Bancor Solves Impermanent Loss (IL Protection)

Bancor introduced IL Protection:

🟢 What It Means

Bancor promised LPs:

“You will NEVER suffer impermanent loss.
If your position is in loss, we will compensate it using protocol revenue + BNT.”

How they did this:

✔️ 4.1 The Protocol tracks each LP position

It tracks:

How much ETH you supplied

What it is worth now

Whether IL occurred

✔️ 4.2 If IL happened, Bancor compensates you in BNT

For example:

You deposit 10 ETH.
Months later, because of AMM rebalancing:

You withdraw 9.2 ETH + some BNT value

Total value < what you would get by simply holding ETH

So Bancor calculates the IL and gives you free BNT that fills the gap.

Thus:

Your withdrawal value = your HODL value

Impermanent loss = 0

This is how they claimed to eliminate impermanent loss.

⭐ 5. The Catch: IL Protection Was Not Immediate

In Bancor V2.1:

Day 0: 0% IL protection

After 30 days: ~30% IL protection

After 100 days: ~100% IL protection

So:

The longer your money stayed,

The more IL protection you received.

This encouraged long-term LPing.

⭐ 6. How the Protection Was Funded

This is extremely important.

Bancor funded the IL protection from:

Protocol fees

Traders paid fees

Fees were used to cover IL

Minting BNT

When needed, Bancor minted new BNT

Used it to offset IL

So IL was not magically removed —
it was socialized across the protocol.

⭐ 7. Did Bancor really eliminate IL?
📌 Answer: It covered IL using protocol funds,

not removed IL mathematically.

Price divergence still happened in pools.
LPs would still suffer IL inside AMM math.

But Bancor compensated them financially,
so the LP never “felt” the loss.

This is like:

Insurance doesn't remove the accident,
it just pays for the damage.

Same idea.

⭐ 8. Why Bancor IL Protection Failed in 2022

During extreme market crashes:

Too many LPs suffered IL

Bancor had to mint huge amounts of BNT to compensate

BNT price fell

Insurance fund collapsed

Bancor halted IL protection

So the model broke under stress.

Because it relied on:

BNT price

Protocol fees

Insurance treasury

This was not sustainable in a bear market.

⭐ 9. Summary: How Bancor Removes IL (In Theory)
Mechanism	Explanation
Single-sided liquidity	LP not forced into 50/50 exposure → lower IL
BNT co-investment	Bancor funds the other side, not the LP
IL Tracking	Protocol continuously tracks impermanent loss
IL Insurance	Bancor mints BNT to cover LP’s losses
Fee Sharing	Trading fees used for insurance funding
⭐ 10. Final Answer (Interview Level)

Does Bancor remove impermanent loss?

Bancor does not mathematically remove impermanent loss.
The AMM still causes IL whenever prices diverge.
Bancor simply insures LPs against IL by minting BNT and using protocol fees.
This makes LPs whole at withdrawal time, effectively “removing” IL from their perspective — although the protocol absorbs the loss.

Perfect, clean and accurate explanation.
